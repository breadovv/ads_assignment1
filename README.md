// In 1st Problem time complexity  is O(n) because it checks every element in array

// In 2nd Problem time complexity is O(n) because it summarize each elemnet in a loop

// In 3rd Problem time complexity is O(sqrt n) because it checks if the number is prime by dividing it until square root of n 

// In 4th Problem time complexity is O(n) because The function makes n recursive calls.

// In 5th Problem time complexity is O(2^n) because it follows this pattern: F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)

// In 6th Problem time complexity is O(b) because it calls itself n times

// In 7th Problem time complexity is O(n) because recursion calls itself n times

// In 8th Problem time complexity is O(n) because recursion calls itself n times

// In 9th Problem time complexity is O(2^n) because the recursion splits into two at each step

// In 10th Problem time complexity is O(logn) because each step reduces a and b significantly
